# AI-KPI

In this repository I do laboratory work on artificial intelligence.

## Lab 1 "Road graph"

Develop an algorithm for generating a road in the form of a graph. Where the vertices of the graph are intersections, and the edges of the graph are roads between intersections. The intersections should be arranged in a square grid.
